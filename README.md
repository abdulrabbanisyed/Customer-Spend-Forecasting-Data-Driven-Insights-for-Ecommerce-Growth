# Ecommerce Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs linear regression analysis on an E-commerce dataset predicting the valued customers who will most likely buy premium/ yearly subscription.

## Skills and Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Data Analysis:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Machine Learning:** Linear regression model building and evaluation
- **Visualization:** Data visualization to derive business insights using matplotlib and seaborn

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved visualizing relationships between various features in the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior.


#### Time Spent on Website vs. Yearly Amount Spent

We used a joint plot to visualize the relationship between the time customers spend on the website and the amount they spend yearly.

### Linear Regression Model

- **Model Building:** Built a linear regression model to predict the purchase amount based on customer demographics and spending score.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Visualizations Bringing Business Insights

- **Income vs. Spending Score:** Scatter plot showing the relationship between annual income and spending score, highlighting high-value customer segments.
- **Age Distribution:** Histogram of customer ages, identifying the most common age groups.
- **Gender Distribution:** Pie chart showing the proportion of male and female customers.
- **Purchase Amount by Gender:** Box plot comparing purchase amounts between male and female customers.
- **Spending Score Distribution:** Density plot of spending scores, helping to identify the distribution of customer spending behavior.

Results
The linear regression model provided insights into the factors influencing purchase amounts, helping businesses to:

Identify high-value customer segments
Tailor marketing strategies to different demographics
Optimize product offerings based on customer spending patterns
