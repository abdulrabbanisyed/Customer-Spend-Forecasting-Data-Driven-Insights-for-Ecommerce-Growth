  # Ecommerce Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs linear regression analysis on an E-commerce dataset predicting the valued customers who will most likely buy premium/ yearly subscription.

## Business Relevant Insights

- **Customer Engagement:** Higher engagement on the app and website correlates with increased spending. This insight can drive investment in enhancing user experience on these platforms.
- **Membership Length:** Longer membership is associated with higher yearly spending, suggesting retention strategies can boost revenue.
-**Targeted Marketing:** Identifying high-value customer segments helps tailor marketing efforts and promotions to maximize ROI.

## Skills and Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Data Analysis:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Machine Learning:** Linear regression model building and evaluation
- **Visualization:** Data visualization to derive business insights using matplotlib and seaborn

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved visualizing relationships between various features in the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior.


#### Time Spent on Website vs. Yearly Amount Spent

We used a joint plot to visualize the relationship between the time customers spend on the website and the amount they spend yearly.

### Linear Regression Model

- **Model Building:** Built a linear regression model to predict the purchase amount based on customer behavior and time spent on the app/website.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics.
- **Output:**:
